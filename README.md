## 🏥 Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis of heart disease can help save lives and reduce treatment costs. This project leverages machine learning classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease using clinical data.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to gain insights into the dataset.
- 🛠️ **Data Preprocessing**, including handling missing values and normalization.
- 🤖 **Model Training** using algorithms like:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- 🎯 **Hyperparameter Tuning** to optimize model performance.
- 🚀 **Deployment** of trained models for real-time predictions.

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. 📥 **Data Collection and Loading:** Import and examine heart disease datasets.
2. 📈 **Data Visualization:** Understand patterns and trends through visual analytics.
3. ⚙️ **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize data, and split into train-test sets.
4. 🧠 **Model Training:** Train classification models using preprocessed data.
5. 📊 **Evaluation:** Assess the performance of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. 💾 **Model Deployment:** Save the best model for deployment.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **Languages:** 🐍 Python
- **Libraries:**
  - 📋 pandas, numpy for data manipulation.
